# BDD Scenario Reference

Rules and format for writing Behaviour-Driven Development scenarios in
Given-When-Then notation. Follow these rules when producing BDD scenarios
for a specification.

## Scenario Format

```
#### Scenario: [Descriptive, action-oriented title]

**Traces to**: User Story [N], Acceptance Scenario [M]
**Category**: [Happy Path | Alternate Path | Error Path | Edge Case]

- **Given** [a precondition that establishes the starting state]
- **And** [an additional precondition, if needed]
- **When** [a single action performed by the actor]
- **Then** [an observable, verifiable outcome]
- **And** [an additional assertion, if needed]
- **But** [something that should NOT happen, if relevant]
```

## Mandatory Rules

1. **Traceability is non-negotiable.** Every scenario MUST have a `Traces to:`
   line that references its parent User Story number AND the specific
   Acceptance Scenario number it elaborates.

2. **One action per When.** The When step describes exactly one action. If a
   workflow involves multiple steps, either split into separate scenarios or
   use And steps under When only for tightly coupled sub-actions that are
   meaningless in isolation.

3. **Category every scenario.** Assign exactly one category:
   - **Happy Path**: The main success flow. The user does the expected thing
     and gets the expected result.
   - **Alternate Path**: A valid but non-default path through the feature.
     Still succeeds, but through a different route.
   - **Error Path**: The user or system encounters an error. The scenario
     verifies correct error handling, messaging, and recovery.
   - **Edge Case**: Boundary conditions, unusual inputs, race conditions,
     or rare-but-possible situations.

4. **Assertions must be observable.** Then steps describe externally visible
   outcomes (UI messages, API responses, state changes, file outputs).
   Never assert on internal implementation details.

5. **Preconditions must be concrete.** Given steps should describe a specific,
   reproducible state — not vague conditions like "the system is ready."

## Parameterised Scenarios (Scenario Outlines)

When the same logic applies to multiple input values, use a Scenario Outline
with an Examples table:

```
#### Scenario Outline: [Title describing the parameterised behaviour]

**Traces to**: User Story [N], Acceptance Scenario [M]
**Category**: [Category]

- **Given** [precondition with `<placeholder>`]
- **When** [action with `<placeholder>`]
- **Then** [outcome with `<placeholder>`]

**Examples**:

| placeholder_1 | placeholder_2 | expected_outcome |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| value_a       | value_b       | result_a         |
| value_c       | value_d       | result_b         |
```

Use Scenario Outlines when:
- Testing the same rule with different valid inputs
- Verifying multiple boundary values
- Covering a matrix of input combinations

Each row in the Examples table becomes an independent test case.

## Background (Shared Preconditions)

When multiple scenarios within the same feature share identical Given steps,
extract them into a Background block:

```
#### Background

- **Given** [shared precondition for all scenarios in this feature]
- **And** [another shared precondition]
```

Place the Background before the first scenario. It runs before each scenario
in the feature. Use sparingly — if only some scenarios share the precondition,
keep it in those individual scenarios.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Implementation leakage**: "Given the database has a users table with
   columns id, name, email" — this couples the scenario to a specific schema.
   Instead: "Given a registered user with email alice@example.com."

2. **Missing assertions**: A scenario with When but no Then is incomplete.
   Every scenario must assert at least one outcome.

3. **Overly broad scenarios**: "Given a user, When they use the system,
   Then it works" — too vague to test. Be specific about inputs and outputs.

4. **Testing implementation, not behaviour**: "Then the function returns
   an array of length 3" — this tests internal structure. Instead: "Then
   3 results are displayed."

5. **Compound When steps**: "When the user logs in and navigates to settings
   and changes their password" — this is three actions. Split into three
   scenarios or use a focused scenario for the specific behaviour.

6. **Orphan scenarios**: A scenario without `Traces to:` is disconnected
   from requirements. Every scenario must trace to a user story.

## Naming Conventions

- Scenario titles should be descriptive and action-oriented.
- Use the actor's perspective: "User resets password with valid token"
  not "Password reset token validation."
- Include the key differentiator: "User submits form with empty required field"
  not just "Form validation."
- For error paths, name the error: "User receives rate limit error after
  10 requests in 1 minute."

## Coverage Checklist

For each user story, verify:

- [ ] At least one Happy Path scenario
- [ ] At least one Error Path scenario
- [ ] Alternate paths for any conditional logic
- [ ] Edge Case scenarios for each boundary condition listed in the spec
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are covered by at least one BDD scenario
